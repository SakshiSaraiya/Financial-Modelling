# Financial-Modelling
This repository presents a comprehensive financial modeling and valuation project for Avenue Supermarts (DMart), one of Indiaâ€™s leading retail chains.  Built entirely in Microsoft Excel, the model includes a fully integrated three-statement financial model (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement), along with detailed supporting schedules for depreciation, working capital, and capital expenditure. It also features calculations for Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model, and scenario analysis to evaluate different growth and funding assumptions. Key outputs include forecasts for revenue, EBITDA, and enterprise value, as well as a valuation summary comparing the base business and expansion case. This project demonstrates core skills in corporate finance, financial forecasting, strategic planning, and business valuation, making it a practical tool for investment analysis and decision-making.
